When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I want to collaborate with the team or share my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: I want to chose and decide what changes I want to bring into my local repository and also have the control to bring changes from others on the remote repository to local.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Fork is used to clone a repository that belongs to someone else into remote repository.
Clone is used to make a copy of the someone's remote repository locally and make changes and then create a remote repository and push local files there.
Branches are used so that we can make experimental coding or want to implement a new feature or a bug fix.
